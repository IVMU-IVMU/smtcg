        <p>Everything started when we were just little boys. We all found joy in playing games
            like Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokémon TCG, and it soon became our dream to create a similar gaming 
            experience. So it began...</p>

        <div class="lijevo">
        <p>This project started in early 2025, with a mass launch within the first 6 months. Every day,
            developers, designers, content writers, media ambassadors, and many others are working their 
            heads off to create the perfect game that people will enjoy for centuries to come.</p>

            <p>Our team is composed of the best of the best—a cherry on top. Each member was carefully
                hand-picked by our project manager, Ivica Mudnić. They are truly remarkable, honest, and 
                hardworking individuals. Working from 9 to 5, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, they couldn't ask 
                for a better team or a better schedule. Their pay ranges from a humble 10 cents an hour to an astonishing 
                100,000 euros per week.</p>

            <p>Strange Matter TCG descended from the heavens and worlds beyond our plane of existence to us, mere peasants
                in comparison, to shine a ray of hope and usher in a new era of TCGs. Starting in April 2025, we began sculpting our 
                TCG and website from the bones of the Earth to the heavens above—beginning with the concept, card art, structure,
                and more. In May 2025, our project exploded into the atmosphere, redefining what a TCG could be—a truly mind-boggling concept.</p>
